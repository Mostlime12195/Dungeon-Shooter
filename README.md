# Dungeon Shooter
## What is Dungeon Shooter?
Dungeon is a small game I'm working on, It's a 2d top-down shooter.
The code is open source under the Apache 2.0 License. You are free to contribute to the game or use this project in your own game!
This game isn't a serious game, the game's meant to teach me more about how to use the Godot engine. When I have most of the features I want, I will mainly fix bugs, improve accessibility, and make the game less resource heavy.
## Todo:
- Improve AI
- Improve Artwork
- Add & replace animations
- Add more guns
