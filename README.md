# Dungeon Shooter
## What is Dungeon Shooter?
Dungeon Shooter is a small game I'm working on, It's a 2d top-down shooter.
The code is open source under the Apache 2.0 License. You are free to contribute to the game or use any of the code for your own project!
This isn't a serious game, this is for practice. When I have most of the features I want, I will mostly fix bugs, improve accessibility, and make the game less resource heavy.
## When will the game release?
I don't plan on releasing the game for a while, the soonest I will release it is when Godot 4.0 is released.
## How can I report bugs and glitches?
Go to the Issues tab of this Github page, create an issue there and detail it.
## Todo:
- Improve AI
- Improve Artwork
- Add & replace animations
- Add more guns
- Add more levels
- Add a GUI
