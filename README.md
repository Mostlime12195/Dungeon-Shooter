# Dungeon Shooter
## What is Dungeon Shooter?
Dungeon Shooter is a small game I'm working on, It's a 2d top-down shooter.
The code is open source under the Apache 2.0 License. You are free to contribute to the game or use any of the code for your own project!
This isn't a serious game, this is for practice. When I have most of the features I want, I will mostly fix bugs, improve accessibility, and make the game less resource heavy.
## Todo:
- Improve AI
- Improve Artwork
- Add & replace animations
- Add more guns
- Add more levels
- Add a GUI
- Improve existing guns
